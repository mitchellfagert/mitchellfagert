### Hi there, I'm Mitch!ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently an active student at UNCC's Data Analytics Boot Camp with a background in public accounting. My passion for technology and numbers pushed me to enroll in the program in June of 2022. This decision has uncovered a trove of new topics and interests that I want to pursue and utilize for gainful employment in the technology sector. Please browse my public repositories which showcase my projects I have completed thus far in the program!
